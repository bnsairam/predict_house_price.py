House Price Prediction
Overview
This project predicts house prices using historical real estate data with machine learning. It uses a Linear Regression model from scikit-learn to predict prices based on features like house size, number of bedrooms, age, and location score. The project includes visualizations using seaborn to show prediction accuracy and feature importance. A bonus section provides code to load data from a CSV or mock API endpoint.
Technologies

Python 3.8+
scikit-learn
pandas
seaborn
matplotlib
requests (for API integration, optional)

Features

Predicts house prices using a Linear Regression model.
Visualizes actual vs. predicted prices with a scatter plot.
Displays feature importance based on model coefficients.
Supports loading real-world data from a CSV or API.

Setup

Clone the Repository:
git clone <repository-url>
cd house-price-predictor


Install Dependencies:Create a virtual environment and install required packages:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib requests


Prepare Data:

The script includes sample data for demonstration.
To use real data, replace the sample dataset in predict_house_price.py with a CSV file containing columns: size_sqft, bedrooms, age, location_score, and price.



Usage

Run the Script:
python predict_house_price.py

This will:

Train a Linear Regression model on the dataset.
Output the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R² score.
Generate two plots:
price_prediction.png: Scatter plot of actual vs. predicted prices.
feature_importance.png: Bar plot of feature importance (coefficient magnitudes).




Output:

Console: Displays MSE and R² score.
Files: Saves price_prediction.png and feature_importance.png in the project directory.



Bonus: Loading Real-World Data
To predict prices using real-world data:

Prepare a CSV file or API endpoint with housing data (columns: size_sqft, bedrooms, age, location_score).
Uncomment the API section in predict_house_price.py if using an API.
Replace api_url with the endpoint URL (e.g., a mock API like https://example.com/housing-data-api).
Run the script to load data and predict prices.

Example:
api_url = 'https://example.com/housing-data-api'

Notes

The sample dataset is synthetically generated with realistic correlations for demonstration. For accurate predictions, use real housing data (e.g., from Kaggle datasets like the Ames Housing Dataset).
The API integration assumes a JSON response with the same column structure as the sample data.
Extend the model by adding features (e.g., number of bathrooms, neighborhood) or trying other algorithms (e.g., Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).
